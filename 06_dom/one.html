<!-- Document Object Model -->
<!-- 
    DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.
    A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
    The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.
    The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:
    "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."
    The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:
    Core DOM - standard model for all document types
    XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
    HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents
    The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:
    With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
    JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
    JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
    JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
    JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
    JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
    JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
    JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page
    The HTML DOM Object Model
    With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.
    When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
